# What is C?
C is a general-purpose, procedural programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in 1972, originally designed for UNIX operating system development. It remains fundamental in computer science, offering low-level memory access and efficient machine instruction mapping while remaining portable across platforms.

# Important Points
1. (Compiled Language: C is a compiled language, meaning your source code (human-readable .c files) must be converted by a compiler (like GCC) into executable machine code before running.)
2. (Procedural and Structured: C follows procedural programming with structured constructs like functions, loops (for, while), and conditionals (if, switch), not object-oriented programming.)
3. (Basic Program Structure: Every C program must have a main() function where execution begins, typically includes header files like #include <stdio.h>, and uses {} braces to group statements.)
4. (Data Types: C has primitive data types including int (integers, 4 bytes), float (decimals, 4 bytes), double (larger decimals, 8 bytes), char (single characters, 1 byte), and void (no value).)
5. (Case-Sensitive and Semicolons: C is case-sensitive (Age ≠ age), statements end with semicolons (;), and it uses curly braces {} to define code blocks.)
6. (Variables and Keywords: Variables must be declared with a type before use (e.g., int age;), and C has only 29 reserved keywords like if, else, int, char, return, while.)
7. (Input/Output Functions: Basic I/O uses functions from <stdio.h>: printf() for output, scanf() for input (e.g., printf("Hello"); prints text)
8. (Memory Management: C provides direct memory access through pointers and manual memory allocation using malloc(), calloc(), and free() functions, giving programmers low-level control.)
9. (Applications: C is used to build operating systems (Windows, UNIX, Linux), embedded systems, device drivers, compilers (Python interpreter, Git), databases (Oracle), and performance-critical applications.)
